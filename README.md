### Toxic comment filter

Training a neural network with recurrent layers in order to develop a multi-label classifier that identifies toxic social media comments. The model also specifies the kind of maliciousness of each comments (threat, obscenity, insult, etc)

### Face detection

Building a model able to detect faces in images, in order to develop a face detection system to be implemented in a consumer camera **without using pre-trained model**. The detection should also work with low computing resources.
